# React Components - Machine Coding Round

This repository includes a set of reusable React components implemented using a **single-file wrapper pattern**. Each component is named with a `Wrapper` suffix and is directly usable via `<ComponentNameWrapper />` in your `App.js`. No external libraries are used unless necessary, ensuring maximum control and learning.
